# 01-Guessing
This is my first project for C220: a guessing game, written in Python. The purpose of this game is to teach me about simple data types and control structures.
The player is asked to guess a number between one and 100. the player then has as many opportunities to refine the guess. The game reports the total number of tries taken.
